### Console Errors
- Open DevTools on any page to see content script errors

- **Stack Overflow** - Site with ads and analytics
- **News sites** - Usually have many tracking scripts
- **E-commerce sites** - Often load lots of JS for functionality

The extension should:

- Not cause any visual changes to websites
- Work on all HTTP/HTTPS sites
- Store data persistently between browser sessions
